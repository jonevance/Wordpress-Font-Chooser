# Wordpress Font Chooser

This is a very simple Wordpress plugin designed to make it a bit easier for a blogger with no HTML experience to 
set the font for an arbitrary piece of content.

## Requirements

As this is a Wordpress plugin, a Wordpress instalation is required.

## Installation

Create a directory called "font-chooser" under your Wordpress plugins directory (i.e. wp-content/plugins) and 
download the source into it.  Remember to activate the plugin from your admin page.
 
## Usage

Wrap content in simple font tags like this: [FontName content].  If the content itself contains a closing brace,
you can escape it with a backslash: [Arial some content with a \] in it].

## Supported fonts

The following fonts are currently supported, as they are known to exist on most computers:

* Arial

* Comic Sans MS
* Courier New
* Georgia1
